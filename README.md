## What is ProtoGlove?

ProtoGlove a simple and efficient, open source, 3D printable **hardware prototyping platform** for DIY hand Motion capture & Haptics for Virtual reality


## What are the goals for this project:
 
- provide a strong, reliable, versatile and universal system on which you can build and experiment your own idea  
- siplify and standardise structural parts to allow you to focus on your idea  
- allow for faster prototyping, and thus faster develmopment  
- acelerate the propagation of new and potentialy better ideas in the comunity by not having to make a whole new glove every time a new desing comes out  
- lower the barrier to entry  


## What we have:

- baseplate (size 7 to 9, complient, rigid, balanced or not, with "thumb plate" or not)  
- harness parts for 15mm nylon strap  
- ESP32 mounts flat or vertical  
- basic fingertip module  
- "finger guides" with or without snap-fit rails, wire-pass-throught, hot glued or stitched  
- "snap fit" rails for mounting modules booth on the baseplate and the "finger guides"  
- base modules that you can remix to implement your own ideas
- interchanchable and custumizsble controller/tracker mount    
- support for EVERY controllers  
- fingertip modules, with option for mounting LRAs


## What's missing:

- different size baseplate (for size 5-6 & 10-13)  
- more tip module sizes 
- a way to access the buttons on the ESP that are currently blocked by the ESP mount  
- add support for more board like Arduino nano
- add placeholder models for commonly used coponents (esp32, potetiometers, servos and more)

## How you can build your own ProtoGlove?

-what tools you need:  
  - 3Dprinter  
  - 2mm or 5/64" drill bit (for reaming holes, you can use a similarly sized screw driver if you don't have one)  
  - 120/180 grit sand paper (for flatening/scratching glued surfaces)
  - (optional) heavy-duty side cutters, or a hack saw (for cutting the nails to lenght)

-what materials you need:  
  - PLA (100 grams should be more than enough for 1 glove)  
  - superglue  
  - 25x2mm mild steel, flat head nails (for the harness latching points, indexing parts, and can be used as cheap axles for small mechanism)  
  - 15mm wide nylon strap (for the harness)

build instructions coming soon, if you need help contact me on my discord

## Desings that uses the ProtoGlove system
- Val's OverFlow glove (coming soon)

## How YOU can help this porject!

- you can make/provide models (see in the "what's missing list")  
- you can join my discord to give suggestions and ideas and participate in the comunity  
- you can help me right documentaion (like this unfinished readme uh..)
- you can help financialy by suppoting me on patreon
