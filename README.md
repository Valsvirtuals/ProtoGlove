## What is ProtoGlove?

ProtoGlove is a simple and efficient, open source, 3D printable **hardware prototyping platform** for DIY Hand Motion Capture & Haptics for Virtual Reality.


## What are the goals for this project:
 
- Provide a strong, reliable, versatile and universal system on which you can build and experiment with your own ideas 
- Simplify and standardize structural components to allow you to focus on your idea  
- Allow for faster prototyping, and thus faster development  
- Accelerate the propagation of new and potentially better ideas in the community by not having to make a whole new glove every time a new design comes out
- Lower the barrier to entry


## What we have:

- Baseplate (size 5 to 13, compliant, rigid, balanced or not, with "thumb plate" or not)  
- Harness parts for 15mm nylon strap  
- ESP32 mounts flat or vertical  
- Basic fingertip module, with option for mounting LRAs  
- "Finger guides" with or without snap-fit rails, wire-pass-through, either hot glued or stitched  
- "Snap-fit" rails for mounting modules both on the baseplate and the "finger guides"  
- Blank modules that you can remix to implement your own ideas
- Interchangeable and customizable controller/tracker mount    
- Support for ALL controller styles


## What's Missing:
  
- More tip module sizes 
- A way to access the buttons on the ESP that are currently blocked by the ESP mount  
- Add support for more micro controllers like Arduino nano
- Add placeholder modules for commonly used components (esp32, potentiometers, servos and more)

## How can you build your own ProtoGlove?

- What tools you need:  
  - A 3D printer  
  - 2mm or 5/64" drill bit (for reaming holes, you can use a similarly sized screwdriver if you don't have one)  
  - 120/180 grit sandpaper (for flattening/scratching glued surfaces)
  - (optional) heavy-duty side cutters, or a hack saw (for cutting the nails to length)

- What materials you need:  
  - Filament (PLA and PETG work best. 100 grams should be more than enough for 1 glove)  
  - superglue  
  - 30x2mm mild steel flat head nails (for the harness latching points, universal controller mount, indexing parts, and can be used as cheap axles for small mechanism)  
  - 15mm wide nylon strap (for the harness and universal controller mount)
